                <h2>About</h2>
                <p><strong>"Ruoka-aika"</strong> (translated as <strong>"Mealtime"</strong>) is a 2D game developed
                    using Unity. This project was created
                    as part of an internship at the Finnish Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
                    (FAIDD).</p>
                <p>In the game, players feed farm animals according to given instructions. The objective is to reach 100
                    points, and the game concludes after three incorrect attempts.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This feeding game was made as an internship project with <strong>Finnish Association on Intellectual and
                    Developmental Disabilities
                    (FAIDD)</strong> as apart of my studies at Taitotalo. We were split into smaller teams and each team
                was assigned
                games that we were going to be remaking in Unity. </p>

            <p>Our teams were one the first ones to be apart of FAIDD's mission to remake their old games so this game
                will be used as a <strong>model</strong> for future games for their revamped website <a
                    href="https://papunet.net/what-is-papunet/" target="_blank">Papunet</a>.</p>
            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>I was responsible for the gameplay and menu programming using C# and Unity. Key features I implemented
                include:</p>

            <p>Interactive UI for feeding animals and tracking scores.</p>
            <p>Real-time feedback for player actions.</p>
            <p>Integration of audio and visual effects to enhance user experience.</p>

            <h2>Collaboration and Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Games being accsessible for everyone is important and this collaboration with Papunet allowed me to learn
                alot about it.</p>
            <p>We were in close contanct with Papunets accessibility experts to make sure all aspects of the game were
                up to the player's needs</p>


            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p>During development, we encountered several challenges:</p>

            <p><strong>Optimization for Accessibility:</strong> Ensured the game was accessible to individuals with
                varying levels of intellectual disabilities by implementing intuitive controls and clear
                instructions.</p>
            <p><strong>Maintaining Performance:</strong> Optimized the game to run smoothly on various devices by
                efficient asset management and code optimization.</p>

            <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
            <p>The game was well-received by FAIDD and contributed to the their mission of updating the websites games.
            </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>Used as a model for updating other games in the FAIDD's collection.</p>


            <h2>Additional Information</h2>
            <p>"Ruoka-aika" is part of the FAIDD's initiative to update their old Flash games with newer technology. The
                updated games are hosted on their newly revamped website, <a href="https://papunet.net/what-is-papunet/"
                    target="_blank">Papunet</a>.</p>
            <p>Papunet offers a variety of materials and information designed to aid its users with communication needs,
                including games, books, and other tools. Ruoka-aika contributes to this mission by providing an engaging
                and accessible gaming experience for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>

            <p>I also gave an interview along with another team member about our work on this project on Papunets
                website to advertise these revamped games. The interview
                discusses the collaboration with students from different schools to create more games in the future and
                our experiences working with them. In the interview, I talked about the collaborative process with
                FAIDD, the importance of accessibility, and what I learned about accommodating special needs in game
                development. Full finnish article can be found <a
