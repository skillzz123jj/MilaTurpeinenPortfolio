                <h2>About</h2>
                <p><strong>"Coin Hunt"</strong> is a 2D game made with Python. This project was created
                    as the final assignment of the advanced Python
                    programming course at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.</p>
                <p>In the game, the player picks up as many coins as possible while dodging monsters. Survival time is
                    tracked, and the player needs to stay alive as long as possible. They can buy temporary upgrades to
                    aid them with the coins they have collected.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This game was made as a final assignment of the course at the Department of Computer Science at the
                University of Helsinki.</p> There is an introductory course as well as an advanced Python programming
            course. These <a href="https://programming-24.mooc.fi/" target="_blank">courses</a> are open to
            everyone
            and provide a good
            foundation in programming. Attendees receive a
            <strong>certificate</strong> upon completion.

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>The game was developed in Visual Studio Code using Python with the Pygame extension. All course students
                were provided with the same four images, and we came up with the game ideas ourselves.</p>

            <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
            <p>The games were distributed to other students for peer reviews, and I received positive feedback. One
                review mentioned that the game was <strong>'creative'</strong> and had <strong>'a good tempo'</strong>.
                Another comment
                noted that the
                code was <strong>well-organized</strong>. The overall score was 4.67/5.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot about good programming practices and approaches in this course. The course covered basic
                data types, methods, loops, files, recursion, object-oriented programming, and much more.</p>
